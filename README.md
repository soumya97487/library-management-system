üö´ Restricted Access (Pre-Payment): Members cannot upload books or view book PDFs until a successful rental payment is completed, ensuring content security.

üíª Technologies Used
This project is built using a modern and powerful MERN stack variant, ensuring scalability and performance:

Frontend:

React.js: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

Backend:

Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment for building fast and scalable network applications.

Express.js: A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building RESTful APIs.

MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database, offering high performance, high availability, and easy scalability for storing application data.

Payment Gateway:

Razorpay: A leading payment solution for secure and seamless online payment processing.

Architecture:

RESTful API: A well-defined architectural style for communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring clear and efficient data exchange.

üöÄ Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the Library Management System on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

Node.js: (LTS version recommended) - Download from nodejs.org.

npm: (Node Package Manager) or Yarn: - Usually comes with Node.js, or install Yarn globally (npm install -g yarn).

MongoDB: (running locally or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas) - Download from mongodb.com or set up a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd library-management-system

(Remember to replace <your-repository-url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the backend directory (or wherever your Node.js/Express app resides) and install dependencies:

cd backend # Adjust this path if your backend is in a different folder
npm install # or yarn install

Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following environment variables. These are crucial for the backend to function correctly:

PORT=5000 # Or any desired port for the backend server
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string # e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/library or your Atlas connection string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key # A strong, random string for JSON Web Token (JWT) secret
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id # Your Razorpay Key ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret # Your Razorpay Key Secret
# Add any other necessary environment variables for file uploads, email services, etc.

Important: Replace placeholder values with your actual MongoDB connection string, a strong JWT secret, and your Razorpay API keys.

Run Backend:
Start the backend server:

npm start # or node server.js (if your main file is server.js)

The backend server should now be running, typically accessible at http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate into the frontend directory (or wherever your React app resides) and install dependencies:

cd ../frontend # Adjust this path if your frontend is in a different folder
npm install # or yarn install

Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the following environment variables:

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api # Or your backend's deployed URL (e.g., https://api.yourdomain.com/api)
# Add any other necessary frontend-specific environment variables

Run Frontend:
Start the React development server:

npm start

The React development server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:3000.

üí° Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port your frontend is running on).

Admin/Librarian: Log in with appropriate credentials to access the full suite of library management features, including book, author, borrower, and category administration.

Member: Register as a new member or log in to browse the extensive collection of books, initiate rental processes, make secure payments, and gain access to rented digital content.
